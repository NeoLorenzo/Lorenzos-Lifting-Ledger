# Exercise → Muscle Hypertrophic Relevance Matrix

## Purpose

This matrix converts the project's anatomical movement model into a **first-pass estimate of worthwhile hypertrophic involvement for each exercise**.

It is designed to solve the problem that a muscle can be anatomically capable of contributing to a movement without receiving enough loading for that contribution to be useful in a hypertrophy-focused app. For example, pectoralis major can contribute to some shoulder actions present in a lat pulldown, but a lat pulldown should not therefore be treated like meaningful chest training.

The final matrix contains the exact 138-exercise catalogue and the project's 40 muscle entities.

## Coefficient contract

Each value is an independent **Exercise–Muscle Hypertrophic Relevance coefficient** under the assumption of one sufficiently hard set, normal intended technique, and a normal/full useful range of motion.

| Value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `1.00` | Principal hypertrophy target |
| `0.75` | Major target / very substantial contribution |
| `0.50` | Substantial secondary contribution |
| `0.25` | Small but worthwhile contribution |
| `0` | Do not count as meaningful hypertrophic stimulus |

The values are **not percentages**, are not normalized, and are not measurements of actual muscle growth. A row can contain multiple `1.00` values.

These coefficients describe the *exercise*, not the quality of a particular logged set. Variables such as RIR, load progression, set count, execution quality, and fatigue should be modelled separately downstream.

## Construction method

The mapping was built in three stages:

1. **Exercise → Movement Pattern matrix**
   - Defines the dynamic and materially loaded isometric actions present in each exercise.

2. **Movement Pattern → Muscle Function matrix**
   - Defines which tracked muscles are anatomically capable of producing those actions.

3. **Exercise-specific hypertrophy audit**
   - Removes anatomically possible but practically incidental muscles.
   - Adjusts relative relevance for joint position, muscle length, biarticular interference, exercise support, resistance geometry, and available longitudinal hypertrophy evidence.

The movement-pattern model therefore constrains the final mapping but does not mechanically determine it.

## Important corrections made by this layer

- **Lat pulldowns:** pectoralis major and pectoralis minor are not counted merely because they can contribute to some component shoulder/scapular actions.
- **Squat/leg-press patterns:** hamstrings are not given meaningful hypertrophy credit simply because they are anatomical hip extensors.
- **Hip thrusts:** hamstrings are not treated as major targets despite their hip-extension function.
- **Leg curls:** seated curls give greater relevance to the biarticular hamstrings than prone curls.
- **Triceps extensions:** overhead variants give maximal relevance to the long head; neutral-arm pushdowns give the long head less credit.
- **Lateral raises:** dumbbell variants include more upper-trapezius relevance than cable variants.
- **Supported rows:** externally supported exercises do not receive the erector-spinae credit assigned to genuinely unsupported bent-over rows.
- **Chest flies vs pulldowns:** the sternocostal pectoralis can receive `1.00` on a pec fly while receiving `0` on a pulldown.

## Exercise assumptions

The following catalogue-specific assumptions were supplied explicitly:

- `Back Extensions (Dumbbell)` = 45° hyperextension bench.
- `Dips (Machine)` = chest-focused seated dip machine.
- `Overhead Press (Landmine) (Barbell) (Kneeling)` = unilateral one-arm landmine press.
- `Row (Dumbbell) (Bent Over) (Unilateral)` = non-working hand/arm supported on a bench or rack.
- Generic incline machine presses are treated as moderate incline presses, approximately 30–45°.

Machine mappings describe the generic exercise geometry rather than any particular manufacturer unless the catalogue explicitly defines a unique movement.

## Current limitation

This remains a **modelled estimate of worthwhile hypertrophic relevance**, not a direct measurement of stimulus.

There is no scientifically validated method for converting every logged resistance-training exercise into a precise numerical quantity of future muscle growth. The matrix should therefore be used as a disciplined, auditable approximation rather than presented as biological ground truth.

Future high-quality longitudinal evidence can revise individual exercise–muscle coefficients without changing the underlying architecture.
